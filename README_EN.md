## Project Overview
This project implements the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** algorithm, a classic example of symmetric encryption used for secure data transmission. The program supports encryption and decryption of text, along with Base64 encoding and decoding to ensure encrypted data can be stored or transmitted effectively.

## DES Principles

### What is DES?
**DES (Data Encryption Standard)** is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm proposed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and widely used for encrypting sensitive data, such as in the financial sector. DES encrypts 64-bit plaintext using a 64-bit key, producing a 64-bit ciphertext.

**Encryption Type**: Symmetric encryption  
**Key Length**: 64 bits (with 8 bits used as parity bits)  
**Encryption Process**: 16 rounds of Feistel network iteration

### DES Encryption Process

1. **Initial Permutation (IP)**: The plaintext undergoes a bit-level transformation before encryption.
2. **Partitioning and Key Generation**: The 64-bit plaintext is divided into left (L) and right (R) sections, and 16 subkeys are generated.
3. **16 Rounds of Iteration**:
   - Expand the right section R to 48 bits.
   - XOR the data with the subkey.
   - Use S-box substitution to reduce the data back to 32 bits.
   - Swap the left and right sections.
4. **Inverse Initial Permutation (IP-1)**: The final 64-bit ciphertext is produced.

## Project Structure
- `DES_BOX.py`: Contains constants used in the DES algorithm, such as initial permutation tables, S-boxes, and P-box.
- `main.py`: Core encryption and decryption logic, along with user interaction.

## Main Features

### üìù File Handling
- **`read_file(filename)`**: Reads plaintext from a specified text file.
- **`write_file(message)`**: Writes encrypted ciphertext to the `ciphertext.txt` file.

### üîê Base64 Encoding and Decoding
- **`base64_encode(bit_string)`**: Converts a binary string into Base64 encoding for easy storage and transmission.
- **`base64_decode(encoded_string)`**: Reverts the Base64 encoding back to a binary string.

### üîë Key and Plaintext Processing
- **`process_key(key)`**: Processes the input key string to generate a 64-bit key.
- **`str_bit(message)`**: Converts a plaintext string to a binary bit string.
- **`divide(bits, bit)`**: Splits the binary stream into 64-bit segments for encryption.

### üîí DES Encryption and Decryption
- **`des_encrypt(bits, key)`**: Encrypts a 64-bit plaintext block using DES, returning the ciphertext.
- **`des_decrypt(bits, key)`**: Decrypts a 64-bit ciphertext block, returning the plaintext.
- **`all_des_encrypt(message, key)`**: Encrypts the entire plaintext in segments, producing the complete ciphertext.
- **`all_des_decrypt(message, key)`**: Decrypts the entire ciphertext in segments, recovering the original plaintext.

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- This is my setup
- **Python 3.11** 
- No additional libraries are required; `base64` is part of the Python standard library.

### Usage Steps

1. Store the plaintext in a `plaintext.txt` file.
2. Run the program and choose between encryption or decryption:
   - Press `1` for encryption: After entering the key, the program outputs the encrypted ciphertext and writes it to `ciphertext.txt`.
   - Press `2` for decryption: After entering the key, the program decrypts the ciphertext and displays the original plaintext.
   - Press `3` to exit.

```bash
# Run the command
python DES_Python.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Encryption
1. Save the following text as `plaintext.txt`:
   ```
   IAmABoy!
   ```
2. Run the program and select encryption:
   ```plaintext
   Encrypt press 1   Decrypt press 2   Exit press 3 : 1
   Input the password you want to set: lxhelloo
   ```

   **Output**:

   ![üîê Encryption Result](encrypt_img.png)
   ```plaintext
   Encrypt press 1   Decrypt press 2   Exit press 3 : 1
   Input the password you want to set: lxhelloo
   Plaintext:  IAmABoy!
   Plaintext 01bits:   0100100101000001011011010100000101000010011011110111100100100001

   Ciphertext 01bits:  1110010001110001011000011111011000011100111111011010000001001001
   Ciphertext:  5HFh9hz9oEk=
   ```
   - Shows the binary representation of the plaintext.
   - Displays the generated ciphertext (Base64 encoded).
   - The ciphertext is saved in `ciphertext.txt`.

### Decryption
1. Run the program and select decryption:
   ```plaintext
   Encrypt press 1   Decrypt press 2   Exit press 3 : 2
   Input your password: lxhelloo
   ```

   **Output**:
   ![Decryption Result](decrypt_img.png)

   ```plaintext
   Encrypt press 1   Decrypt press 2   Exit press 3 : 2
   Ciphertext:  5HFh9hz9oEk=
   Input your password: lxhelloo
   Ciphertext 01bits:   1110010001110001011000011111011000011100111111011010000001001001
   
   Plaintext 01bits:    0100100101000001011011010100000101000010011011110111100100100001
   Plaintext:   IAmABoy!
   ```
   - Shows the binary representation of the decrypted plaintext.
   - Outputs the original plaintext.

---

## Notes
- The key must be 8 characters long, and the program automatically handles the parity bits.
- Plaintext shorter than 64 bits will be padded with zeros.
- Encryption and decryption must use the same key, or the result will be incorrect.
- Ensure the ciphertext file (`ciphertext.txt`) is Base64 encoded for ease of reading and transmission.
